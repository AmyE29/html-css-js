# HTML Structure and Layout

HTML development is for the content of your web page.  CSS give the page it's style.  HTML will be a .html file, which will link to your style.css file.

An **important** thing to know about HTML is that every opening tag, needs to have a closing tag.  The structure of a basic HTML page would looke similar to this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
        This is what goes on the tab in your bowser
        </title>
    </head>
    <body> 
    The content of your website goes here this may include
       <header>
            <h1> Main Heading </h1>
            <nav> 
                <ul>
                    <li> add a few naivgation links </li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p> put is some wording </p>
        </section>
    <footer> put some info for the footer </footer>
    </body>
</html>

You can add many different sections, or articles within the section.  You can add a 'aside' to make some content seperated.

Once you're done with your HTML, you create a *style.css* sheet to change:

- color of the page
- location of image
- image size 
- change the font
